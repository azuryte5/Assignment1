# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

## Purpose of Assignment 
* User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

* Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Unique Comments
- I really tried to get the webpage to match the mock up with my screen size. I did not apply flex elements to code but my desktop screen is set to 1900 x 1080. View webpage content from this resolution for best view of image and container spacing.

- I made up some of my own classes, and recombined CSS to minimize space while keeping code intact to match mock up

- I made the git repository with the directory "urban-octo-telegram-main" but ideally I would have removed this folder but I didn't know how to do this just yet. Challenge 2 I'll be sure to start in the correct directory.

- There was no footer in the mock up so I removed it but it seemed strange to have web content with no footer, so I kept it in comments for the time being.
